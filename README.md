# redux-todo-lit-element
The [redux todo example](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todos), written using lit-element.

To run, just go to the directory and start a web server, such as

```
python3 -m http.server
```

This is an educational experiment, showing that lit-element is really vanilla javascript, that can be used
without compilation. In the real world, you would still want to build your javascript.
